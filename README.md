ZX Spectrum 48K emulator

The source code can be built using Visual Studio 2015, 2017 or 2019.

Target platform: Windows 8.1
Platform toolset: Visual Studio 2015 (v140)

Other dependencies:
- DirectX (DirectDraw, DirectInput, DirectSound)
- MFC

I developed this software to be my thesis work in 2000 for Windows 98. I've found the source code in my archive and decided to share and make it to be open source.

Note: The Z80 CPU emulation supports only the public instruction set.

Issues have been found:
- Full screen mode breaks
- Sound generation doesn't work
